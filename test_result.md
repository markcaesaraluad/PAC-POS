# Test Results and Development Log

## Original User Problem Statement
Building a modern, web-based Point of Sale (POS) System for "Prints & Cuts Tagum" with multi-business/multi-tenant support, including Super Admin role, CRUD operations for products/categories/customers, sales processing, inventory management, barcode scanning, receipt generation, and reporting features.

## Testing Protocol
- MUST test BACKEND first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- After backend testing, ASK user whether to test frontend or not
- ONLY test frontend if user explicitly requests it
- NEVER invoke frontend testing without user permission
- When backend code changes, ALWAYS test backend first
- Follow minimum steps when editing this file

## Current Development Phase
**Phase 4: Receipt Generation & Printing System + Sales Reports**

## Recent Changes Made
- Backend services created: email_service.py, receipt_service.py, print_service.py
- Dependencies added: weasyprint, html2text for PDF generation
- Invoice API routes updated with receipt functionality
- Need to complete sales routes integration

## Issues Identified
1. **Authentication Token Persistence**: Tokens may be expiring causing unwanted redirects
2. **Data Display**: Backend data (products, categories) not displaying correctly on frontend dashboard
3. **Receipt System**: Incomplete implementation of receipt generation and printing
4. **Reports System**: New requirement - Excel/PDF downloadable reports for sales and other data

## Testing Results
*To be updated by testing agents*

## Next Steps
1. Fix authentication issues
2. Complete receipt generation system
3. Add comprehensive reporting system with Excel/PDF downloads
4. Test all functionality end-to-end

## Incorporate User Feedback
- User confirmed plan to proceed with current approach
- Added new requirement: Sales reports and other reports downloadable as Excel or PDF
- Priority on fixing existing functionality before adding new features
