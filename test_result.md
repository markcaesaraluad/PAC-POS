ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Frontend is likely sending null/undefined values for required fields (cashier_id, cashier_name, sku, unit_price_snapshot, unit_cost_snapshot) causing Pydantic validation failures. The 'failed to complete sales' error is primarily due to missing or null required fields from frontend form validation issues."

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The Sales API backend is functioning correctly with no critical issues found. The reported 'failed to complete sales' error is NOT caused by backend API failures. The issue is likely: 1) Frontend validation or error handling problems, 2) User input validation issues, 3) Network connectivity problems, or 4) Frontend-backend communication issues. TECHNICAL VERIFICATION: All core sales functionality verified including basic sales creation, enhanced fields (payment reference codes, downpayment handling), multiple payment methods, proper validation, stock checking, and authentication. The backend Sales API is production-ready and handling all transaction types correctly. Minor: Authentication error code returned 403 instead of expected 401 (non-critical difference).

TECHNICAL DETAILS: Authentication working (‚úÖ), Products API working (‚úÖ 41 products), Categories API working (‚úÖ 3 categories), Customers API failing (‚ùå 500 error). The frontend shows 'No products found' because the catch block in fetchData() runs when Promise.all fails, preventing setProducts() from executing. SOLUTION NEEDED: Fix customers API 500 error OR modify frontend to handle partial API failures gracefully. This is a critical production issue affecting core POS functionality."

ISSUE IDENTIFIED: CustomerResponse model required 'updated_at' field but customers API routes were missing this field in database operations and response construction. ERROR DETAILS: Pydantic validation error - 'updated_at field required' was causing 500 Internal Server Error in GET /api/customers endpoint. SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Added missing 'updated_at' field to all customer operations: 1) Customer creation now includes updated_at timestamp, 2) Customer retrieval (get_customers) now includes updated_at with fallback, 3) Customer update operations now set updated_at timestamp, 4) Individual customer retrieval (get_customer) now includes updated_at field. VERIFICATION COMPLETED: All three APIs now working correctly - Products API (44 items), Categories API (3 items), Customers API (8 items). Promise.all() sequence in POS frontend will now succeed, allowing products to display correctly. The POS interface should now show products instead of 'No products found' message.

ASSESSMENT: Auto-print functionality is WORKING as designed - the system successfully completes transactions and triggers the auto-print logic.

The POS system correctly identifies when to trigger auto-print and executes the print commands.

PAYMENT VALIDATION NOW WORKING: After fix, console logs show 'Payment validation: {received: 20, total: 19.99, modalReceivedAmount: 20, totals: Object}' confirming proper state updates.
